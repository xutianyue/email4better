Hi Alex,

Quick follow-up on the fabrication work. We were expecting the finished frames yesterday so we could start install today. Can you share an updated schedule? The client walkthrough is booked for next Thursday afternoon.

Thanks,
Jamie`,

Hey Dana,

Could we pull tomorrow’s GTM sync earlier? My 1:30 got moved last-minute and I’m double booked now. Any chance we could slide to a morning slot?

Thanks!

We’re sorry the FloorGlow arrived damaged. Could you send us a few photos of the packaging and the damaged areas? That will help us file the carrier claim quickly.

Hi Aurora team,

Just circling back on the damaged FloorGlow lamp I emailed about last week. I sent the photos you requested on Thursday but haven’t heard back yet. It arrived with a dented base and cracked shade. Can you let me know the next steps?

Thanks,
Taylor`,

Thanks for hosting the workflow automation session today—lots of useful ideas. Could you send the recording when it’s ready? I’d also love the checklist you mentioned near the end.
